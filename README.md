# Dice Roller Project

## Description

The Dice Roller Project is a simple command-line application that simulates rolling dice. Users can specify how many dice they want to roll, and the application will generate random numbers between 1 and 6 for each die. The results are displayed alongside the total sum of the rolled values.

## Features

- Roll a specified number of dice.
- Display individual roll results.
- Calculate and show the total sum of the rolled values.
- Handle user input with error checking.
- Exit the application gracefully by typing 'exit'.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Download the project files from the repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

## Usage

Run the application using the following command:

```bash
python dice_roller.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to roll the dice. Enter a number to roll that many dice or type `exit` to quit the program.

## Example

```
How many dice would you like to roll? 3
4, 2, 5
Total: 11
How many dice would you like to roll? exit
Thanks for playing!
